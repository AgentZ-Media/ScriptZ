## Installation (first time only)

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

1. Download the `.dmg` below and open it.
2. Drag **ScriptZ.app** into your **Applications** folder.
3. The app is **not signed** (no Apple Developer account), so macOS
   refuses to launch it. Run this command in Terminal once to remove
   the quarantine flag:

   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/ScriptZ.app
   ```

4. Open ScriptZ from the Applications folder - it now launches
   normally.

Without step 3, you'll see the message "ScriptZ is damaged and can't
be opened" or "can't be opened because the developer cannot be
verified". That's macOS Gatekeeper, not the app.

### Windows (x64)

1. Download the `.exe` installer below and run it.
2. On first launch, **Windows SmartScreen** kicks in: "Windows
   protected your PC". The app is **not signed** (no EV code-signing
   certificate), so SmartScreen doesn't know it yet.
3. Click **"More info"**, then the button that appears: **"Run
   anyway"**.
4. From there on, ScriptZ runs normally. Auto-updates work without
   any further friction.

Without step 3, SmartScreen aborts the launch. That's Windows
protection, not the app.
